# Giter8 template for create ImageJ2 plugins in Scala

## Requirements

- SBT version 0.13.13 or above

## Basic Usage
To setup an SBT project for a new ImageJ2 plugin is as easy as:

```
sbt new keithschulze/ij-plugin-sbt.g8
```

You'll be prompted for some information about the plugin you want to develop and then a new SBT project will be setup.

SBT can be daunting when starting out. It is worth the effort though. You can get information about it from the [SBT website](http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html).
